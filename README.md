# Gtk shell

It's an example how to have a desktop shell client for Weston based on a real
toolkit.

The idea is that this client and any other based on any toolkit can be
interchangeable to use with a single desktop plugin like the [weston desktop
plugin](https://github.com/tiagovignatti/weston-desktop-plugin). Therefore,
one compositor, with a single desktop plugin can be used as a foundation for
building different shell UIs based on different graphics toolkits.
