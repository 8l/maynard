This is a desktop shell client for Weston based on GTK. It was based
on weston-gtk-shell, a project by Tiago Vignatti.

## Original idea

The idea is that this client and any other based on any toolkit can be
interchangeable to use with a single desktop plugin like the [weston desktop
plugin](https://github.com/tiagovignatti/weston-desktop-plugin). Therefore,
one compositor, with a single desktop plugin can be used as a foundation for
building different shell UIs based on different graphics toolkits.
